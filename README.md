## 🏗️ System Architecture

### End-to-End Data Flow

1. Sensors collect physiological and environmental data.
2. ESP32 processes signals and formats data packets.
3. Data is transmitted securely via MQTT over WiFi to AWS IoT Core.
4. AWS Lambda bridges sensor data to Firebase Firestore for storage and real-time syncing.
5. FastAPI backend runs sliding-window statistical analysis for sleep and executes Keras/TFLite models for cry classification.
6. Mobile application streams insights via Firestore/RTDB and receives real-time FCM Push Notifications for alerts.

This architecture ensures low latency, secure communication, and scalability.
